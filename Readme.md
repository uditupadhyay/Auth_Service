# Auth Service

This micro-service mainly focuses on the authorization and authentication of the users.

- `Authentication`: It is a process by which we can uniquely identify users on our application. This process tells about who the user is.

- `Authorization`: It is a process by which we can identify the capabilities of a user i.e what a user can do in our application.
  Eg, we use Flipkart so when logging in as a normal user you have different access and when you log in as a seller it's different, a seller can sell the products on the app, not the normal user.
